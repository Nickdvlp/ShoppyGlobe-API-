This is E-Commerce Platform calling ShoppyGlobe. I used many methods and hooks to create this.

Hooks Which I Used:-

useState:- to manage state Variables.

useEffect: to modify fetched data from taking context api.

useContext: i used this hook for taking fetched data from context api. context api fetch data at once serve for entire application.

useSeletor: to select slice data and use that in component.

Redux:-
I am using Redux for two purposes. first for search query and second for cart items state managing.

I am using two extra components separately:- first is "Add to Cart" Button because need to use this multiple files so created separately at once.
second is star ratings component which used in Product Details page for showing ratings of product.
